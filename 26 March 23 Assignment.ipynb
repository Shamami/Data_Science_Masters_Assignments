    "Simple linear regression is a statistical method that helps us understand the relationship between two continuous variables, where one variable is the predictor or independent variable and the other is the response or dependent variable. The goal of simple linear regression is to find a line that best fits the data points. This line is called the regression line or line of best fit. The equation of a simple linear regression model is y = β0 + β1x + ε, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, β0 and β1 are coefficients, and ε is the error term. Simple linear regression has only one independent variable.\n",

    "For example, suppose we want to predict the weight of a person based on their height. Here, weight is the dependent variable and height is the independent variable. We can use simple linear regression to find a line that best fits the data points and use this line to predict the weight of a person based on their height.\n",

    "Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables, x and y. Before conducting linear regression, we must ensure that four assumptions are met :\n",
    "1. Linear relationship: There exists a linear relationship between the independent variable, x, and the dependent variable, y.\n",
    "2. Independence: The residuals are independent. In particular, there is no correlation between consecutive residuals in time series data.\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: The residuals have constant variance at every level of x.\n",
    "4. Normality: The residuals of the model are normally distributed.\n",
    "If one or more of these assumptions are violated, then the results of our linear regression may be unreliable or even misleading.\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, we can use the following methods:\n",
    "5. Linear relationship: We can create a scatter plot of x vs. y to visually see if there is a linear relationship between the two variables 1. If it looks like the points in the plot could fall along a straight line, then there exists some type of linear relationship between the two variables and this assumption is met. If not, we can apply a nonlinear transformation to the independent and/or dependent variable or add another independent variable to the model 1.\n",
    "6. Independence: We can look at a residual time series plot, which is a plot of residuals vs. time . Ideally, most of the residual autocorrelations should fall within the 95% confidence bands around zero 1.\n",
    "7. Homoscedasticity: We can create a scatter plot of residuals vs. predicted values and check if there is any pattern in the plot . If there is no pattern, then homoscedasticity assumption is met.\n",
    "8. Normality: We can create a histogram or Q-Q plot of residuals to check if they follow normal distribution .\n",
    "If any of these assumptions are violated, we may need to consider using alternative regression methods or transforming our data before conducting linear regression."

The slope of this model represents how much the price changes for every unit increase in size. The intercept represents the price of a house when its size is zero, which is not meaningful in this context .\n",

    "Gradient descent is a simple optimization procedure that is widely used in machine learning to minimize the error between predicted and actual results . It is an iterative algorithm that adjusts the parameters of a model to minimize a cost function. The cost function measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. The goal of gradient descent is to find the minimum of this cost function by iteratively adjusting the parameters of the model .\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by calculating the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter of the model. The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of steepest ascent of the cost function. By taking steps in the opposite direction of this vector, we can iteratively move towards the minimum of the cost function .\n",

    "There are three types of gradient descent: batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent . In batch gradient descent, we calculate the derivative from all training data before calculating an update.

In mini-batch gradient descent, we sum the error for each point in a training set, updating the model only after processing a small batch of data .\n",

    "In multiple linear regression, multicollinearity refers to a situation where two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other. This can cause problems in the regression model, such as unstable and unreliable estimates of the regression coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to detect multicollinearity in a multiple linear regression model. One way is to calculate the correlation matrix between the independent variables and look for high correlation coefficients. Another way is to calculate the variance inflation factor (VIF) for each independent variable. A VIF greater than 1 indicates that multicollinearity may be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address multicollinearity, one approach is to remove one or more of the highly correlated independent variables from the model. Another approach is to combine the correlated independent variables into a single variable using principal component analysis (PCA) or factor analysis.\n",

    "It’s important to note that multicollinearity is not always a problem in multiple linear regression. In some cases, it may not affect the estimates of the regression coefficients or their standard errors. However, it can still make it difficult to interpret the results of the regression model."

    "Polynomial regression is a special case of multiple linear regression. It models the relationship between the independent variable x and dependent variable y as an nth degree polynomial in x. Linear regression, on the other hand, estimates the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable using a straight line .\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of polynomial regression over linear regression is that it can fit non-linear data better. Linear regression is not suitable for fitting non-linear data, which can lead to underfitting 1. Polynomial regression can also be used to model complex relationships between variables .\n",
    "\n",
    "However, polynomial regression has some disadvantages as well. One disadvantage is that it can be more computationally expensive than linear regression, especially when dealing with high-degree polynomials . Another disadvantage is that it can be prone to overfitting, which occurs when the model fits the training data too closely and does not generalize well to new data .\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, polynomial regression should be used when there is a clear non-linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It can also be used when there are multiple independent variables and a complex relationship between them 1. However, it should be used with caution and the degree of the polynomial should be chosen carefully to avoid overfitting ."
